Summary: I'm a geodata analysis with a passion for challenging data


![profile sphere](../images/vvgvlh1d10u-slava-bowman.jpg "Source:unsplash.io")

My education is in geospatial sciences (MSc) and social sciences (PhD). I am a self-taught data visualisation specialist, using javascript libraries for mapping (GoogleMaps, Carto, Leaflet, and OL3) and graphing (D3). I use python and pandas to analyse text and numbers.

This personal page is meant to write about technical subjects, but I also have a [website](http://wwww.helenedraux.net), built with wordpress, where I write about present my projects. I have a [portflio](http://www.helenedraux.net/portfolio-all/), which includes a gallery of [static maps](http://www.helenedraux.net/portfolio/portsmouth-maps/), and [D3 projects](http://www.helenedraux.net/portfolio/d3-gallery/).
