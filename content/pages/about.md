Summary: I'm a geodata analysis with a passion for challenging data


![profile sphere](../images/vvgvlh1d10u-slava-bowman.jpg "Source:unsplash.com")

My education is in geospatial sciences (MSc) and social sciences (PhD). I am a self-taught data visualisation specialist, using javascript libraries for mapping (GoogleMaps, Carto, Leaflet, and OL3) and graphing (D3). I use python and pandas to analyse text and numbers.

This personal blog hosted on github and powered by pelican is meant to write about the `how` of my projects. It's very easy to update and to integrate python notebooks.

I also have a [website](http://wwww.helenedraux.net), built with wordpress, where I write about present my projects. I have a [portfolio](http://www.helenedraux.net/portfolio-all/), which includes a gallery of [static maps](http://www.helenedraux.net/portfolio/portsmouth-maps/), and [D3 projects](http://www.helenedraux.net/portfolio/d3-gallery/).

## The configuration of this blog

I use [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), with a tailored version of [Alchemy](https://github.com/nairobilug/pelican-alchemy) (Bootstrap4 based theme).

It is hosted on github, where I have two repository: the entire pelican code is on helenedraux.github.io-src; the output folder is a submodules with its own repository on helenedraux.github.io. I think it's the best way to have pelican under git.

I used tutorials from [ptyagicodecamp](https://ptyagicodecamp.github.io/my-take-on-pelican-and-github-pages-from-a-beginners-perspective.html) to learn how to publish pelican on github with two repositories. Great automating script!
